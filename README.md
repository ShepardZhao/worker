# worker

A tiny micro library to help make using web workers easier. Spins up an inline web worker for you with the option of adding a fallback method in case creating the worker fails. The API for interacting with a web worker remains exactly the same, it is just the creation that is more abstracted.

### Install

```
bower install --save worker
```

### Basic Usage

```JS
var myWorker = $worker(function(e) {
  var sum = 0;
  
  e.data.forEach(function(int) {
    sum += int;
  });
  
  self.postMessage(sum);
});

myWorker.onmessage = function(data) {
  console.log(data);
};

myWorker.postMessage([1,2,3,4,5]);
```

### API

#### $worker
factory - creates a new web worker

| --------|---------|-------|
| func  | Function   | the code to be used in the web worker    |
